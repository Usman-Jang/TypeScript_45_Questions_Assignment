/* Qs.45 Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object.The function
should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number
of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs,
such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information
was stored correctly. */

// Define the function to store car information

  // Add additional options to the car object
  options.forEach((option) => {
    for (let key in option) {

// Call the function with required information and additional options
const myCar = carInfo("Toyota", "Corolla", { color: "blue" }, { year: 2022 });

// Print the returned object
